#Tower Defence game for Android in development

This is joint effort of two friends to make Android tower defence game, where you have to defend Cotton Candy against hordes of goblins, zombies, witches and whatnots. You are welcome to watch the repo and play dev builds as we develop it.

##Towers

* Mage towers (use ranged spells to damage units)
* Brute towers (use ranged projectiles to damage units)
* Utility towers (slow units, knockback units, trap units, doesn't damage)
** I will probably include utilities as tower upgrades

##Enemies
  This list is work in progress...
* goblins (low HP, fast moving, no resistance)
* ogres (high HP, slow moving, high damage resistance - armor)
* shamans (low HP, medium moving, high spell resistance - shield)

##New wave gameflow
As soon as you kill all enemies, small box pops up with "Good job" text and button to continue to next wave. It's probably good if there's displayed also the amount of gold you earned this wave and small tip "Don't forget to build new towers or upgrade existing". When you click a button, box should hide and big screen overlay should tell you which wave it is and how much is left until end. After few seconds (3?) it hides and you are allowed to build and upgrade towers. At top border of screen there's a button to start the wave.
